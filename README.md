# Maximum-area-triangle-in-convex-polygon

We implement three algorithms for finding MAT(maximum area triangle) in a convex polygon. 

MAT-CM.h:  implementation of an algorithm by Chadran and Mount (published in IJCGA 92). 

MAT-K.h:   implementation of an algorithm by Kallus (arXiv 1706.03049).

MAT-Jin.h: implementation of an algorithm by myself, Kai Jin (arXiv 1707.04071). 

1.in to 7.in:  7 data cases generated by makedata.cpp.

experiment.cpp: This is the main cpp file which tests the three algorithms using the data cases 1.in~7.in.

It will generate 6 files for each test case ?.in:

?J.out ?C.out ?K.out:   The answer to ?.in given by three algorithms respectively.

?J.txt ?C.txt ?K.txt:   Number of iterations used by the three algorithms respectively.

MAT(GCC).exe: exe file of experiment.cpp (complied by MinGW GCC -- release mode of eclipse/CDT).

MAT(VC).exe:  exe file of experiment.cpp (complied by VC -- release mode of VS2018).

exp-GCC.png, exp-gcc.txt, exp-VC.png, exp-VC.txt:  these are the results of the experiment.

The running eviroment is: Thinkpand X1 carbon 6th. (windows 10 64bit, i7-8550U CPU @1.80GHz 1.99GHz, 8GB/RAM).
